# Conclusion

In this project, we started with the analysis for specialty vs wait times, as the exploratory analysis gave us an initial signal that specialty may be correlated with wait times, as the scatterplots of the various combinations of the variables showed that the specialties showed a ‘banded’ pattern when it was paired and plotted versus wait times, and some specialties appeared to have greater variation in wait times than others. The ‘banded’ pattern occurred due to the specialty variable being categorical (discrete datapoints).

We used multiple linear regression for specialty vs. wait times, and found that our model explained 20% of the variation in the dependent variable (wait times). Although we can give an estimate of average wait times in Nova Scotia based on specialty from the model, only the wait times from the following specialties are statistically significant: General Surgery, Dental, Opthalmology, Orthopaedic, and Otolaryngology (ENT) at 95% confidence. However, as the model is statistically significant with all the coefficients, then it can be assumed that the model can predict with 95% confidence the wait times from any specialty, even if the individual coefficient is not statistically significant.

In summary, our model for specialty vs. total wait times (consult plus surgery wait times) was statistically significant, as indicated by our F-statistic with a p < 0.05. This F-statistic analysis was performed with all of the specialties included in the model, without backward elimination. Hence, the following prediction model is useful for predicting wait times in Nova Scotia, trained from data in the years 2014 to 2016:

#### waittimes = 257.71 - 117.31(Cardiac Surgery) + 180.16(Dental) + 50.39(Neurosurgery) - 24.23(Obstetrics/Gynaecology) + 250.74(Opthalmology) + 136.10(Oral Maxillofacial) + 440.68(Orthopaedic) + 218.69(Otolaryngology (ENT)) + 115.49(Plastic Surgery) - 39.88(Thoracic Surgery) + 15.10(Urology) + 100.79(Vascular Surgery)

(Note: the default is General Surgery, where all the other specialty variables = 0)

## Future Direction

We will continue to explore for any correlations between wait times and the other variables in this surgical wait times dataset, such as Procedure, Provider, Zone, Facility, Period, Year, and Quarter. We plan on continuing the modeling in linear regression and polynomial regression (if indicated). 

We also want to correlate the wait times with actual data regarding morbidity and mortality rates (probability of worsening illness and dying on the waitlist). We need to collect those datapoints regarding actual morbidity and mortality, so that we can make predictions about a patient’s morbidity and mortality risks when they are placed on a wait-list for a surgical procedure, based on the statistical modeling techniques that we performed here.

Stay tuned for further developments of this project, aimed at improving the healthcare of Nova Scotians who are forced on these surgical wait lists.
