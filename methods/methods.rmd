# Methods

This study involved obtaining a clinical dataset from an open data portal on the internet, loading the data into our analytical environment, exploring the data using analytical software, cleaning the data, determining feature variables (independent variables), and utilizing the data to train models for prediction of the outcome variable(s).

The research team divided the work into the following tasks:\newline

* Project topic selection (C.C., G.H., W.W., C.S.)
* Dataset selection (C.C., W.W.)
* Data cleaning (C.C., G.H.)
* Exploratory analysis and multiple linear regression in R (G.H., W.W.)
* Multiple linear regression and polynomial regression in Python (C.C. and G.H.)
* Visualization of data and graphs (G.H.)
* Research, report writing, and editing (C.C., G.H., W.W., C.S.)\newline

Initially, the data had to be cleaned, as there were many missing values. This was performed manually, as the column and rows were populated haphazardly, and therefore had to inspect and note the missing values, row by row (12 columns and about 7000 rows). Subsequently, business and clinical rules were followed to fill in missing values, utilizing the clinical domain expertise of one of the authors (C.C.) who had practiced as a physician in Nova Scotia for several years. As an example of missing values, each of the surgical procedures had to be classified into the surgical specialty to which it belonged, as many of the rows were missing this information. In addition, there were missing values for hospital, Health Region Zone, procedure performed by surgeon, and specialty of the surgeon. Any missing values not obtainable within the dataset were scraped from the internet to populate the missing values, such as hospital information and information on the surgeon.

Once the dataset was cleaned and missing values were replaced with inferred values from domain expertise and/or web scraping, exploratory statistical analysis was performed on the surgical wait times dataset in Nova Scotia. The research team was trying to determine if there were any correlations between the numerous independent variables (i.e. specialty, period, facility, etc.) and the dependent variable (surgical wait times). This exploratory analysis was the beginning of an ongoing, in-depth analysis of the Nova Scotia Surgical Wait Times, to help to improve patient care through data analysis and statistical modelling.

R and Python were utilized to perform exploratory, descriptive, and predictive statistical analysis on the surgical wait times dataset in Nova Scotia, for the time period 2014 to 2016.

## Acquire the Surgical Wait Times Data
The surgical wait times data was obtained from the Nova Scotia Government [Open Data Portal.](https://data.novascotia.ca/) Here are the steps to acquire the dataset:

1) Navigate to the Open Data Portal
2) Select the Data Catalogue
3) Search ‘surgical wait times’
4) Select Surgical Wait Times
5) Select the Export option
6) Select CSV
7) Save the data file to the project subdirectory (nova_scotia_wait_times/data_analysis/data).
8) Load the data from a tab-separated-values formatted file with column headers

## Wrangle the Data

Once the data was loaded, the feature names of the data set were determined:

[1] Period        [2] Specialty       [3] Procedure       [4] Provider      
[5] Zone          [6] Facility        [7] Year            [8] Quarter       
[9] Consult_Median  [10] Consult_90th   [11] Surgery_Median [12] Surgery_90th

The dataset contained 6843 observations and 12 features. Here are the definitions of the 12 features in the dataset:

Feature         | Definition
--------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------
Period          | Time period
Specialty       | Surgical specialty
Procedure       | Surgical procedure
Provider        | Surgeon
Zone            | Healthcare Zone, 1 to 4
Facility        | Hospital
Year            | Year
Quarter         | Quarter (3-months)
Consult_Median  | Maximum time that 50% of patients recently waited for consult
Consult_90th    | Maximum time that 90% of patients recently waited for consult
Surgery_Median  | Maximum time that 50% of patients recently waited for surgery
Surgery_90th    | Maximum time that 90% of patients recently waited for surgery

The surgical specialty types were parsed as follows: specialty, all specialties, cardiac, dental, general, neurosurgery, obstetrics/gynaecology, ophthalmology, oral and maxillofacial, oral maxillofacial, orthopaedic, otolaryngology (ent), plastic, thoracic, urology, vascular. In total, there are 15 surgical specialty types and 159 surgical procedure types.

After exploring the dataset for features to study, only observations with surgical procedure type ‘all’ were extracted:

 feature       | missing_count| nonmissing_count
 ------------- | ------------ | ----------------
 consult_90th  | 12           |  284

The minimum, maximum, average, standard deviation, and total combined wait days by consultation and surgery specialty. Average wait days is the median number of days on the surgical wait list:

## Visualise the Data

After wrangling the data, the data was visualized: 
  
  
Figure 1.  
![](figures/newplot-1.png)
  
  
Figure 1 shows the total wait time in person years, grouped by surgical specialty. Cardiac surgery has the lowest value, while orthopaedic has the highest.  
  
  
Figure 2.  
![](figures/newplot-2.png)
  
  
Figure 2 shows the median total wait time in days, grouped by surgical specialty. Cardiac surgery has the lowest value, while orthopaedic has the highest.  
  
  
Figure 3.  
![](figures/newplot-3.png)
  
  
Figure 3 shows the wait time distribution in days, grouped by surgical specialty. Notice cardiac surgery and thoracic surgery at the lower end, and orthopaedic at the higher end.  
  
  
Figure 4.  
![](figures/newplot-4.png)
  
  
Figure 4 shows the histogram of the frequencies of the wait times. Most people are waiting between 100 to 200 days for their surgical procedure.  
  
  
Figure 5.  
![](figures/newplot-5.png)
  
  
Figure 5 shows the histogram of the frequencies of the wait times, grouped by consultation wait times and surgery wait times. Most people are waiting between 50 days and 200 days for a consulation, and between 50 to 250 days for a surgical procedure.  
  
It was determined from the dataset that the total wait time to receive a surgical procedure is the sum of the consultation wait time and the surgical wait time. The domain expert who had worked in the system (C.C.) for several years interpreted the total wait time for a surgical procedure as the sum of the following wait times:  
* Wait time to see a family doctor, who will determine if a surgery consultation is needed (family doctor wait time)
* Wait time to consult with a surgeon (consult wait time)
* Wait time for the surgical procedure (surgery wait time)  
  
So the total wait time to receive a surgical procedure is as follows:  
  
#### Total Wait Time = Family Doctor Wait Time + Consult Wait Time + Surgery Wait Time  

But this dataset is missing the Family Doctor Wait Time, so the estimated wait times for surgical procedures in this analysis is missing the Family Doctor Wait Time. Therefore, any estimated prediction of wait times from this study is an underestimate of the real wait time.
