# Abstract
**OBJECTIVE:** Surgical wait times in Nova Scotia are at crisis levels, as patients are waiting too long on the wait list. This can lead to worsening illness course, and in some cases premature death. This project started with the objective of addressing the surgical waitlist crisis, as people in Nova Scotia are waiting months to years before receiving their life-saving surgeries. \newline

**METHODS:** This study involved obtaining a clinical dataset from an open data portal on the internet, loading the data into our analytical environment, exploring the data using analytical software, cleaning the data, determining feature variables (independent variables), and utilizing the data to train models for prediction of the outcome variable(s). R was utilized to perform exploratory, descriptive, and predictive statistical analysis on the surgical wait times dataset in Nova Scotia, for the time period 2014 to 2016. \newline

**RESULTS:** A bivariate multiple linear regression model was constructed with two dependent variables (consult_90th and surgery_90th), representing the 90th percentiles for each instance of a surgical specialtyâ€™s wait time, added together to give the combined surgical wait time and one independent variable. \newline

**CONCLUSIONS:** Although we can give an estimate of average wait times in Nova Scotia based on specialty from the model, only the waittimes from the following specialties are statistically significant: General Surgery, Dental, Opthalmology, Orthopaedic, and Otolaryngology (ENT) at 95% confidence. However, as the model is statistically significant with all the coefficients, then it can be assumed that the model can predict with 95% confidence the wait times from any specialty, even if the individual coefficient is not statistically significant.
