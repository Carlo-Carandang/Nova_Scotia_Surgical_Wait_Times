Surgical wait times in Nova Scotia are at crisis levels, as patients are waiting too long on the wait list. This can lead to worsening illness course, and in some cases premature death. This project started as we wanted to tackle the surgical waitlist crisis, as people in Nova Scotia are waiting months to years before receiving their life-saving surgeries. the Nova Scotia government website only gives numbers about wait times that are difficult to interpret. We wanted to look for correlations of the variables in the surgical wait times dataset. In fact, every province has a wait times dataset that is updated every 3 months, and post the data to the Canadian Institute for Health Information public-facing website. The data goes back to the beginning of the recordings, which is roughly around the early 2010s.

The data set for surgical wait times in Nova Scotia, it has a dozen columns, and around 7000 rows, when we obtained the dataset for the years 2014 to 2016. Itâ€™s basically an excel spreadsheet, and is not in any relational database tables. It maps surgical wait times based on date, hospital, Health Region Zone, specialty, procedure, and doctor.

We know that surgical wait times are associated with significant morbidity and mortality risk [@coughlin2015; @malaisrie2014; @kulkarni2009; @rexius2004; @koomen2001; @everhart1997]. Morbidity risk is the probability of the illness worsening, while mortality risk is the probability of dying from the illness. We know that the surgical wait times in Nova Scotia are at crisis-levels currently. We also know how long patients are waiting on average to receive their procedure in Nova Scotia. However, we do not know how the data informs us to improve services and hence morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is important to analyze the wait times data using advanced statistical and data analytics to help provide more insights to help decrease morbidity and mortality from waiting for surgical procedures.

Even though the most urgent surgeries get scheduled first, waiting too long for surgery can be detrimental to one's health because waiting too long is a burden on the patient and their family, waiting too long can lead to death, and waiting too long can lead to worsening of the illness. Indeed, while the most urgent surgeries get scheduled first, waiting too long for surgery can be detrimental to one's health.
Ultimately, we wanted to find the factors associated with surgical wait times, so that new insights can be obtained to decrease the wait times, and hence save lives and prevent illness deterioration.
